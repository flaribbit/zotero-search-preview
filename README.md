# zotero-search-preview

Zotero is good. The search function of Zotero is good. But it doesn't show the preview of the search result. See:

So I decide to make my own search tool for Zotero. This tool will show the preview of the search result.

## Features
- Search pdf files by regex
- Annotaions in the pdf files are included in the search
- Highlight the matched text in the preview
- Open the pdf file with default pdf viewer
